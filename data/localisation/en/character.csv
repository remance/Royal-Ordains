"Barren_orc_leader_juggernaut","Bigger Orc","An orc juggernaut. A bulwark of the orc army. Can withstand anything, really.",
"Barren_orc_leader_totem","Sharper Orc ","An orc totem carrier. A symbol of faith for all tribal orcs. Can support and crush enemies at the same time.",
"Barren_orc_leader_warmaster","Thicker Orc","An orc warlord. Lead by example. That is by pure might.","Despite popular belief, even an orc's raiding party has a hierarchy. Typically, one of the smartest and meanest orcs in the tribe can become the leader."
"Barren_orc_lookout","Longer Orc","An orc lookout. Equipped with a stick and stones for light combat."," A taller-than-average orc is typically selected as a tribe lookout. They can see further after all. "
"Barren_orc_shoulder","Harder Orc","An orc charger. This orc can crush almost everything in their path.","The muscle is a powerful thing. After rigorous training in bumping hard things with their shoulder all day, every day,"
"Barren_orc_wardancer","Cooler Orc","An orc wardancer. This orc actually knows how to dance in rhythm and fight at the same time. Witness the glory of might and grace.","To dance is to bear one soul to the god, or so the belief goes. "
"Barren_troll_boulder","Calmer Troll","A midlife troll that became calmer with age. A troll can be strong enough to throw a boulder, but it requires steady aim to actually hit something.",
"Barren_troll_ram","Angrier Troll","A young troll that is still hot-blooded in growth. Few can withstand their crushing blows; not even a resolute knight can match their might.","Nothing is scarier than a troll rushing in with a log in arm."
"Barren_troll_old","Wiser Troll","A wise troll capable of using earth element magic to surprising effects. ","An old troll that became wiser with age. A rarity for a troll to survive enough to be old. "
"Castle_cat_air_rocket_bomb","Rocket Cat","A flying cat with the aid of a jar rocket. Can rain down powerful explosives, but is completely helpless against air enemies.","The jar rocket technology is the finest discovery of the alchemists of the central realms yet. Packed with specially crafted ever-burning firepowder, these jar rockets can continuously fly for longer than an hour. Since they are still impossible to mass-produce, this expensive invention found its most cost-effective use for small flying devices. Due to their small stature and no fear of height, cats are found to be the most qualified pilots of all. After delivering bombs to the adversaries, these cats will fly back to an empty field near their camp, unstrap the jar, and drop down safely to the ground."
"Castle_cat_shield_crossbow","Shielded Crossbowcat","A cat armed with a light crossbow and a small tower shield. Can deliver high damage bolts, but at a shorter range than bows and slings.","Economical and effective. These cats are the Central Realms' traditional choice for their frontline army. Their small stature allows them to take cover safely behind their shield, and the light crossbows can reliably penetrate light armour. This great combination was conceived by General Getrier the Quick during the Siege of Alunia against a superior number of archery-defending forces."
"Castle_dog_catapult","Catapult","A self-propelled catapult operated by a dog engineer. A reliable weapon of siege warfare.","Seemingly automated catapults manned by a dog siege engineer. In truth, they are propelled by a hidden army of trained mice. With a bunch of gears and precise engineering, even mice can slowly move this heavy machine to wherever it needs to be. Such a genius invention that can only be conceived from the necessity of war."
"Castle_dog_flail","Flaildog","A dog soldier with a flail. Quite capable in melee. Can unleash devastating long-range melee attacks and stun enemies.","The main force of the Central Realms. These warrior dogs are rigorously trained from a young puppy with a ball stick. Since dogs are fast learners, a year or two of training allows them become as good as average human squires, and that is good enough for a war or two. Dogs are surely man's best friends both in peace and in war."
"Castle_human_air_flying_monk","Flying Monk","A monk equipped with artificial wings. No one really knows how the wings work, but one thing is certain: this monk will smack the unworthies down with impunity.","Monks are curious people. While worshipping God, they also yearn to understand his creation. And at what place for such goals to most likely be achieved than being the closest to him in heaven? They spent centuries accomplishing the impossible, artificial flying wings that can carry a person to the sky. And so, sky meditation and prayer become the most venerated activities for these monks. Anyone who dares trespass on their holy domain deserves only death."
"Castle_human_castle","Castle","A feudal castle is an essential foundation for all settlements of the Central Realm. Only with an overwhelming offence can this castle be breached.","A network of towers and walls forms into a castle most formidable. These castles are symbols of safety for civilisation. The cold and harsh wilderness of the outside world can be too much to bear for those without natural might. They are often both birthplace and tomb for many people, lords and commoners alike."
"Castle_human_flower_castle_crossbow","Flower Castle Crossbowman","A crossbowman on top of a castle. Provide strong defence against invaders.",
"Castle_human_castle_crossbow","Castle Crossbowman","A crossbowman on top of a castle. Provide strong defence against invaders.",
"Castle_human_castle_horn","Castle Horn Blower","A horn player. The sound will inflict fear on enemies and encourage allies.",
"Castle_human_flower_castle","Flower Castle","A castle designed to withstand all sorts of invaders. Only the mightiest of armies or creatures can topple its formidable defence.","When life is full of danger, only greater castles can last long enough to have the benefit of considering glamour in their design. After withstanding against both nature and invaders for so long, the original utilitarian design of these specific castles has proven unfallible. And so the lord of these castles deems them treasure to be polished and beautified. A great number of flowers are then decorated and maintained all over. Thus, tools becomes prizes to be protected rather than utilised."
"Castle_human_flower_knight","Flower Knight","The elite of the Elites. Provided with the most advanced heavy armour development and a two-handed greatsword. Can only walk toward enemies, but can cleave through almost anything.","Flowers are a symbol of significance for the Central Realms. Only the most accomplished of warriors are bestowed the status of Flower Knights, the highest honour for lowborns and highborns alike. Rather than acting as escorts for royalty and lords, Flower Knights' place is in the midst of combat, cleaving at enemies of the realm. Fearless and renowned, these are the finest that the Central Realms have to offer."
"Castle_human_knight","Foot Knight","The elite of the Central Realm. This human knight excels in both offence and defence.","These knights are minor nobles who are nothing short of professional soldiers. Regularly trained from a young age and having funds to acquire high-quality equipment, they can still dominate a battlefield even without their horse. Flimsy weapons and arrows have no hope of even harming the flesh behind the armour."
"Castle_human_knight_cav","Knight","The ultimate shock troop of the Central Realm. Will trample most with a devastating charge.","Nothing in the civilised history can match the reputation of these knight cavalry. There is a reason that the Central Realms have been employing them against significant threats since time immemorial. Not even the strength of orcs, the agility of elves, the fortitude of dwarves, or the cunning of goblins could stop their mighty charge."
"Castle_human_leader_banner","Banner Bearer","A human bannerman. Extremely important for all armies of great renown. Can raise a banner to provide buffs to nearby friends, but cannot attack anyone.","A warbanner is the symbol of an army. As long as the symbol stands firm, it represents that victory is still within grasp. These Banner Bearers harbour with them the very hope of their fellows. Since a tall banner is very weighty, it requires both hands to carry and raise. Leaving the bearers unarmed in combat, only the bravest of warriors are selected for this role of the utmost importance."
"Castle_human_leader_jester","Jester","A human jester. Full of finesse and wit that may be out of place in battle. Cannot really attack anyone, but has many tricks to inflict on enemies.","No one actually knows why a jester should be in battle. Not even the jesters themselves. In fact, it is not even in their job description. This is why they do not display mirth and joy in combat, unlike their performance in court."
"Castle_human_leader_lord","Lord","A human lord on his high horse. Trained in warfare enough to lead lowborns into victory. Sufficiently skilled in combat and can provide support to allies.","There is no feudal society without a lord to rule. From a small village to a great city, the lords are there to preserve order inside the walls. Possessing money and time to train in warfare, they are also the leader of the army against all manners of threats against civilised people. Such is the noblesse oblige to society."
"Castle_human_leader_mage","Mage","A human mage trained in a common magic school. Can unleash a number of magical element spells on enemies from afar.","Wizened mages who are a bit too old for combat. The Central Realms do not have a speciality in magical arts as opposed to military arts. Even court mages do not receive much funding for research, making them available to focus only on fundamental magic spells. Old mages like this typically join an army to collect a salary for their teaching funding. The staff they carry is, in fact, a walking staff that has no magical property whatsoever. Indeed, Central mages are regarded with respect, yet neglected."
"Castle_human_leader_ranger","Ranger","A ranger equipped with a bow and fast feet. Can use a healing kit to heal self and nearby allies.","For a civilisation to thrive, balance with the wilderness is necessary. These rangers are protectors and caretakers against trespassers of the vert and venison. The Royal Law of the Central Realms dictates that all verts within the boundary of divine mandate belong to the King and lords. As such, with expertise in archery, they can hunt dangerous animals and criminals alike."
"Castle_human_militia_bow","Bow Militia","A drafted hunter and the like. Can use the bow to some effects. Useful for a mass long-range barrage.","In the Central Realms culture, archery is a primary subject of learning for both lowborns and nobles alike. Having already attained the fundamental, their acceptable performance transfers well enough when deployed en masse against a large quantity of enemies. These militias are often more likely to survive long enough to return home as veterans compared to those levied as spear militias."
"Castle_human_militia_spear","Militia","A lowly drafted peasant with inferior equipment. Weak overall, but good enough to protect the countryside from minor raids.","Matters of great import, such as food supply, are administered only by humans in the Central Realm culture. These militias are comprised of farm owners and workers who take up arms in times of emergency or are drafted by the lords to bolster the army. Since they are not regularly or formally trained, they are but the lowest of soldiers a realm can deploy."
"Death_bat_air","Dark Bat","A flying bat. Can be a real nuisance to air enemies. Its bite is infected with poison.",
"Death_gargoyle_air","Flying Gargoyle","A flying gargoyle. Strong and sturdy with its stone body.",

Very slow, but can rain down a lot of fire bombs.","Written somewhere, ""An inflatable airship 1-to-100 scale model with a self-regenerative helium mini generator"". These balloons would be a flying fortress if they were larger in size. Manned with a captain doll, a firstmate doll and two crewmate dolls, these dolls actually do not really get along much. It is astonishing that they manage to leave the port in place at all with all the brickering, let alone fly into battle. Nonetheless, they are still the pride of the Doll Family because of how expensive they are to maintain."
"Doll_candle_spear","Candelabra Doll","A doll carrying a candelabra. Can stab like a spear, doing fire damage.","Written somewhere, ""A mass-produced antique Roman-style model series candelabra pushie-type doll"".

Can support friendly allies from behind.","Written somewhere, ""A mass-produced X-537 series model security, surveillance, and control extender slim quadrotor drone"".

When eagles grow old, they lose their valuable feathers and can no longer fly. So they instead take one last flight to migrate down to the ocean and then become aquatic creatures."

Very fast and can debuff nearby enemies.","Rabbitman Reroes and their hound partner are the first to ride against the enemies. They are the bravest of all rabbitmen, as courageous as a rabbitman can be. Perhaps the new world will be filled with the descendants of these warriors."
"Small_rabbit_leader_knight","Rabbit Rnight","A rabbitman knight. Not so bad as a frontline leader but expect no grand performance. Somewhat strong in defence but very slow.","Rabbitmen are not strong enough to wear armour. Even an unadorned helmet weighs enough to make them unable to stand tall. These ""knights"" are not nobles like the civilised equivalent, but rather, simply stronger fighters of the warren. For rabbitmen that dedicate too much to the pursuit of war, there is no return to a joyful life ever again."
"Small_rabbit_sling","Rabbit Rooligan","A rabbitman slinger. Decent skirmisher in its own right and can dig the ground to lay trap against approaching enemies.","Stones exist in abundance, even in forests. So it is no surprise that rabbitmen chose the sling as their ranged weapon of choice. No need to carry too much ammunition, and the sling is light to wield. These Rabbit Rooligans also bring a shovel to dig for more slingshots and make a rabbit hole for setting up a trap against invaders. These shovels later on become the symbol of nation-building for both the rabbitmen nations and outsiders."
"Small_rabbit_snail_cav","Rabbit Rhell Rompanion","A rabbitman snail cavalry. Slow but tough.","Rabbitman on a snail, a combination of two ends of attributes that creates paradoxical strength. With the swiftness of rabbitmen and toughness of snails,  Rabbit Rhell Rompanions excel at neither of the two. Conceivably, this amalgamation will divulge its unrecognised advantages in the unforeseen future that puts knights and their horses to shame."
"Small_rabbit_spear","Rabbit Raider","A footsoldier rabbit spearman. Weak but strong in number. Can inflict slow and charge enemies.","The life of Rabbitmen usually involves no fighting. Like their bunny cousins, they tend to flee from predators and can only bite with their meagre teeth at best. The first weapon they picked up was the easiest to learn, the spear. There is joy to be found when the prey can fight back in numbers, reversing the natural order of things. Many believe that such an occurrence is one of the punishments the gods invoke on the civilised chosen for their endless misdeeds against nature."
"Small_rabbit_tower","Rabbit Rower","A small stone tower with a lone stone thrower rabbitman. Solid but not by much. When earth fail, stone will prevail.","Rabbitmen are no strangers to civilised innovations. As their countries grow, so too does the requirement to protect their territory. And surely, as any sedentary society with self-preservation, towers are erected all over to guard the homeland. Thus, the verts and the houses are no different from the other."
"Small_rabbit_tower_thrower","Rabbit Rower Rhrower",,
"Small_rabbit_trebuchet","Rabbit Roulder","A flimsy cheap trebuchet good for small siege. Very slow but deals good damage to buildings.","Rabbitmen are not so well-versed in the art of craftsmanship. These trebuchets are a miracle in themselves, as they do not break down after a single use. With the help of Iri the Traveller, the Alliance manages to mass-produce these little trebuchets cheaply against the formidable stronghold of civilisations. Quantity over quality, and so begins the Vertkin conquest of the world."
"Small_snail_old","Toxic Mollusk","A bitter old snail that retains only disdain for other creatures after living for so long. Will throw his toxic beard at anyone he deems annoying.","Snails are actually wise creatures, as is quite apparent in their sagely old man face. Their favourite motto is ""To know everything one must first know nothing"". Boiling their beards and dropping the infused essence into the eyes of elderly people can cure senility."
"Small_snail_sword","Snail Defender","A young snail armed with a sword and shield. An eternal enemy to all knights. Deals poison damage.","Tortoise worms that always carry around two shields at all times, one to live in and one to protect itself. When rain comes, snails will raise their heads toward heaven and contemplate. Since they like to eat delicious plant leaves of all sorts, every gardener loathes them."
"Summon_ballista","Ballista",,
"Summon_earth_wall","Earth Wall","An earth wall. Huge, durable, and tall enough that it can firmly block almost anything.","Those who can command the land are given a first glimpse of prosperity. To lay bare the secret of the buried treasures of the Origin Mother is the ambition of all earthen wizards."
"Summon_hound","Hound","A hound. Very fast and fierce. Will bite only enemies.","Hounds are honest and loyal creatures. No matter the commands, they will obey without fail. They will never stop and return until their given mission is completed. When hounds are given a bone, they will bury it instead."
"Summon_scorpion","Scorpion","An automated scorpion anti-personnel weapon. Capable of dealing decent damage, but is rather fragile.","Invention of a genius, these Anti-personnel Scorpions require no manual control. These apparatuses will continue shooting at nearby foes until their magazine is empty. Iri the Traveller keeps her secret so well that not even the dwarf master tinkerers have been managing to replicate the function. Some suspect that the technology of these scorpions is the same as that of the Doll Family."
