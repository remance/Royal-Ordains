"Hall",1,"The famed Black Castle. Home of dynasties of kings and queens for four centuries. Newly renovated after its partial destruction thirty years ago by the great dragon Xelanos's attack. People of high birth typically stalk this hall, exchanging court gossip and politic."

"Peace",1,"The light in oneself can only be discovered with one own heart."
0,1,"Martial is a form of art. To be the true master is to train and improve until you achieve beyond the pinnacle of all in existence and reach the realm of gods. Through arts, one can connect with higher existences and gain a comprehension of the lower world."
1,1,"The first of the Royal Ordains' journey started at the outskirsts of the Pamat Forest, home to a variety of uncountable bushes, beasts, and wrongdoers. Here. a Rabbitman tribe had been terrorising the good and honest people of Masendor for many winters. By the order of the wisest and greatest king, the heroes embarked to exterminate all threats, with force if need be."
1,2,"Rabbitmen are among the most common beastmen inhabit throughout the world. Similar to many other minor civilised races, they are capable of learning, simple verbal communication, conductting religious activity and warfare."
1,3,"Rabbitmen typically lived in tribal communes. They are generally a coward band will fight only when they have an advantage or are in danger. They are crude, rude, and exclude of any civilised decorum."
1,4,"In the Pamat Forest alone, the number of Rabbitmen accounts for around a thousand due to their rapid breeding, similar to their rabbit cousins. They make up one big tribe after a series of conquests left unchecked for a decennium due to the previous crisis."
1,1,"With the raiding formation of the Rabbitman tribe perished two morns ago, the Royal Ordains' great deeds were obvious to all who inhabit in Pamat Forest. The rabbitmen, with their allies; vicious snails, and keensight eagles, dispatched their largest force with the sole intention of annihilating the heroes."
1,2,"The alliance was formed to wrestle control of the forest outskirts from a group of armed humanoid bandits. As the forest is between the border of the unfriendly Elven Kingdom, it becomes the perfect place for savage factions to grow unhindered."
1,3,"Snails are mysterious creatures, tall from a mere finger to an adult dwarf. They are capable of wielding simple weapons and only good at defensive combat. Many believe that the big shell is the snail's home. Some snails live long enough to become wise but bitter and often throw their beard at those who annoy them."
1,4,"The eagles were naturally enemy of the rabbitmen but saw that their home was invaded by other races. They temporarily aided the rabbitmen against the more dangerous threats. Their superior sky movement and claw's strength allow for a swift transport and ambush tactic for the troops."
1,5,"The alliance was indeed a fickle one. While the rabbitmen may appear to be the leader, they are more like the grunt ones who did the most works and fighting. Still, despite their small of stature, they are relatively hard-working warriors. An army of rabbitmen may well be the future of warfare where physical might become less needed."
1,6,"This illustration depicts the celebration or possibly ritual that the rabbitmen typically hosted either by themselves or for the alliance roughly every week. Eyewitnesses describe the event as hectic, with rabbitmen singing and dancing around after a grand feast."
1,1,"A week passed since the great victory of the last battle. As per the rule of the alliance, those who prove their strength and valour can challenge the champion and become the leader. The brave heroes of Royal Ordains accepted the invitation and approached the arena with anticipation."
1,2,"Warren mound is a common type of dwelling for rabbitmen. These mounds are about as tall as a story house and consist of connected tunnel entrances. Sometimes created from an artificially made mound, these tiny labyrinths serve as immaculate protection against invaders."
1,3,"The Royal Ordains faced the leaders of the forest kin alliance, Bigta the Dog and Setors the Rabbit. The undefeated champion of probably around ten battles. The rabbit was quick on his feet, and the dog was accurate in her spear thrust. Making them the mightiest of cavalry in the forest."
1,4,"The greatest and only jousting arena existed in the Pamat Forest. Built by the Rabbitman tribe roughly ten years ago before this recorded battle, likely an imitation of the Aneosel Jousting Field at Epsla Na Polad City. Any who can prove to be the strongest here becomes the tribe leader."
2,1,"Deeper into the forest, the Royal Ordains set out to vanquish the bandits. The Pamat forest became a base of operation for outlaw groups of various capabilities. This journey's hunt is for a small yet well-known group that specialises in ambush tactics."
2,2,"The Red Leaf, and many other outlaw groups formed during the start of the chaotic decade after the dragon crisis and have eluded the kingdom's forest rangers since. The current leader was allegedly the daughter of the original founder who was captured and executed years prior to this campaign."
2,3,"In spite of being small in number, The crimes conducted by this outlaw group are numerous in detail. Theft, robbery, murder, smuggling, trespassing, purpresturing, and assarting to name a few. Although this group is distinct from the others in that their charitable acts toward the less fortunate ones were well-known, making them the locals' cherished."
2,4,"A curious change in the method of operation that display an admirable leadership aptitude for a group of unruly pilferers. Necessary action was still required to bring peace and prosperity to the land."
2,5,"This drawing is an ilustration of the dragon Polweire with the initial of the Royal Ordains. PolweireÂ is one of the five known red dragons who represent the never-ending glory. The illustration of five men at the above corner represents the high cardinals of Valle who endorse the group's establishment."
2,6,"There was no further road left for the Red Leaf. A last stand at hand, and judgement must arrive. Such is the end path of malfeasance."
2,7,"A moment of pause before the truth is a respite for both the actors and observers. It is also a moment for the scribes to rest their hand on the demanding task and prepare for the next page."
2,8,"Portiues, the great Trenieuc tree, mother of many Trenieuc trees, and possibly the eldest of all in Panac Forest. Many consider it a symbol of resilience and serenity."
3,1,"The Pamat Forest is home to many creatures of the One God. Brutes and beasts will do anything to survive, but they are not so ferocious that they will throw their life for nothing but to kill their adversary."
3,2,"The change in the wilds is a sign of disturbance to nature. The most probable cause is that someone is manipulating it via magical means. It fell to the Royal Ordains to rebalance and bring peace to the forest once more."
3,3,"Nonetheless, Woodland, by nature, is a dangerous place to traverse, even for the experienced. An alone tree may be able to provide comfort and shelter for the tired, but in abundance, they are master of labyrinths and host of savage wilds."

3,2,"Turtle"
3,3,"The most ferocious of all animals is no doubt a wild boar. One will attempt to charge and gore even those twice its size. Resilient skin, fur, and bone make it a challenging game, even for a skilled huntsman."

5,2,"Bringing them to justice will no doubt establish that the high authority of the Kingdom is absolute and the law is just for all lawbreakers regardless of intention. The nobles surely appreciate a king who maintains order and establishes governance of his domain."
5,3,"Meanwhile, subduing them and integrating their speciality to use for the land will surely open the possibility of change in social advancement. A choice that conforms with his majesty's declaration of welcoming talents regardless of past misdeeds and sins but still a troubling precedent that can bring jeopardy to the Kingdom."

5,4,"A savagery of civilisation and nature in an unbalanced combination led to the invention of deviancy in morality. A glimpse of comfort unattainable amidst the solitude of uncultivated minds corrodes the Lord within. It is the duty of those with higher minds to lead the lost flock back to the Guidance."

,,"The chopping boxes were ready for heads to pass for them. Or possibly for someone else. An outcome the heroes placed a judgment for the history to come. No matter the choice, heads will roll as surely as the river will always flow."
