"Rabbit_forest1.1","The Pamat Forest, a home to an abundant variety of bushes, beasts, and wrongdoers. Here lie the outskirts, where hunters and foragers can harvest the fruits of nature and prosper from the bestowal of heaven. That is, if they are able to survive the wrath of Rabbitmen."
"Rabbit_forest1.2","Rabbitmen are among the most common beastmen inhabit throughout the world. Similar to many other less civilised races, they are capable of learning, simple communication, heresy and warfare."
"Rabbit_forest1.3","Rabbitmen typically live in tribal communes. They are cowards and will fight only when they have great advantages or are in grave danger. They are crude, rude, and exclude of any civilised decorum."
"Rabbit_forest1.4","In the Pamat Forest alone, the number of Rabbitmen accounts for thousands due to their rapid breeding, similar to their bunny cousins. 
They make up one big tribe after a series of conquests left unchecked for a decennium."
"Rabbit_forest2.1","Within the Pamat Forest reside brutes and beasts of many natures. The rabbitmen, with their allies, vicious snails, and keen-sight eagles, made up the dominant force in the region. This Alliance demonstrates abundantly clear that even the Vertkins do not take well to the incursion of civilised people."
"Rabbit_forest2.2","The alliance is formed to wrestle control of the forest. As the forest is between the conflicting border of the Elven Realm Lulislc and the Kingdom of Masendor, it is the perfect place for the Alliance to grow unhindered."
"Rabbit_forest2.3","Snails are mysterious creatures, tall from a mere finger to a dwarf. They are capable of wielding simple weapons and only good at defensive combat. Many believe that the shell is their home. Some snails live long enough to become wise but bitter and throw their beard at those who annoy them."
"Rabbit_forest2.4","The eagles were natural enemies of the rabbitmen. But when they saw that other races invaded their home, they temporarily aided the rabbitmen against the more dangerous threats. Their superior sky movement and claw strength allow for a swift ambush tactic."
"Rabbit_forest2.5","The Alliance was indeed a fickle one. While the rabbitmen may appear to be the leaders, they are more like grunts who do most of the work and fighting. Still, despite their small stature, they are relatively hard-working warriors. An army of rabbitmen may well be the future of warfare, where raw might becomes less needed."
"Rabbit_forest2.6","This illustration depicts the celebration or possibly ritual that the rabbitmen typically hosted either by themselves or for the alliance roughly every month. Eyewitnesses describe the event as hectic, with rabbitmen singing and dancing around after a grand feast."
"Rabbit_forest3.1","Amidst the centre of the forest lies the capital of the alliance. Transformed from a humble warren in the prior peaceful time, here is the seat of power and a place of valour for budding Rabbitmen to prove themselves and become true warriors. Be certain that they will protect the place at all costs."
"Rabbit_forest3.2","The Great Warren of Pamat. The first great warren in the long history of Rabbitmen around the world, and the capital city of the Alliance."
"Rabbit_forest3.3","Warren Mound is a common type of dwelling for rabbitmen. These mounds are about as tall as a story house and consist of connected tunnel entrances. Sometimes created from an artificially made mound, these tiny labyrinths serve as immaculate protection against invaders."
"Rabbit_forest3.4","The greatest and only jousting arena existed in the Pamat Forest. Built by the Rabbitman tribe roughly ages ago, likely an imitation of the Aneosel Jousting Field at Epsla Na Polad City. Anyone who can prove to be the strongest becomes the tribe leader."
"Rabbit_forest4.1","Deep into the forest lies a domain of outlaws and vagrants. The thick Pamat forest is a great environment for establishing a base of operation for those who reside in the dark world. Approximately, hundreds of these riffraffs hide in the Pamat forest at the height of chaotic time."
"Rabbit_forest4.2","The Red Leaf, and many other outlaw groups formed during the start of the chaotic decade after the dragon crisis and have eluded the kingdom's forest rangers since. The current leader was allegedly the daughter of the original founder who was captured and executed years prior to this campaign."
"Rabbit_forest4.3","In spite of being small in number, The crimes conducted by this outlaw group are numerous in detail. Theft, robbery, murder, smuggling, trespassing, purpresturing, and assarting to name a few. Although this group is distinct from the others in that their charitable acts toward the less fortunate ones were well-known, making them the locals' cherished."
"Rabbit_forest4.4","A curious change in the method of operation that display an admirable leadership aptitude for a group of unruly pilferers. Necessary action was still required to bring peace and prosperity to the land."
"Rabbit_forest4.5","This drawing is an ilustration of the dragon Polweire with the initial of the Royal Ordains. Polweire is one of the five known red dragons who represent the never-ending glory. The illustration of five men at the above corner represents the high cardinals of Valle who endorse the group's establishment."
"Rabbit_forest4.6","There was no further road left for the Red Leaf. A last stand at hand, and judgement must arrive. Such is the end path of malfeasance."
"Rabbit_forest4.7","A moment of pause before the truth is a respite for both the actors and observers. It is also a moment for the scribes to rest their hand on the demanding task and prepare for the next page."
"Rabbit_forest4.8","Portiues, the great Trenieuc tree, mother of many Trenieuc trees, and possibly the eldest of all in Pamat Forest. Many consider it a symbol of resilience and serenity."

1,"The Pamat Forest is home to many creatures of the One God. Brutes and beasts will do anything to survive, but they are not so ferocious that they will throw their life for nothing but to kill their adversary."
2,"The change in the wilds is a sign of disturbance to nature. The most probable cause is that someone is manipulating it via magical means. It fell to the Royal Ordains to rebalance and bring peace to the forest once more."
3,"Nonetheless, Woodland, by nature, is a dangerous place to traverse, even for the experienced. An alone tree may be able to provide comfort and shelter for the tired, but in abundance, they are master of labyrinths and host of savage wilds."

2,"Bringing them to justice will no doubt establish that the high authority of the Kingdom is absolute and the law is just for all lawbreakers regardless of intention. The nobles surely appreciate a king who maintains order and establishes governance of his domain."
3,"Meanwhile, subduing them and integrating their speciality to use for the land will surely open the possibility of change in social advancement. A choice that conforms with his majesty's declaration of welcoming talents regardless of past misdeeds and sins but still a troubling precedent that can bring jeopardy to the Kingdom."

A glimpse of comfort unattainable amidst the solitude of uncultivated minds corrodes the Lord within. It is the duty of those with higher minds to lead the lost flock back to the Guidance."
