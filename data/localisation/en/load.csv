0,"White, the purest of all colours, the most radiant. The very symbol of purity manifests in the spectrum of physical aspects. In truth, such an uncorrupted is also the easiest to be tainted."
1,"Red is often regarded as a symbol of honour and battle, for it is the place where blood is drawn in earnest with passions unmatched even by the greatest of love. Many also believe it to be the opposite of white, for only in war can purity not coexist even in duplicity."
2,"Blue, the gentleness and ferocity in the very same existence. When one thinks of blue, the water body is the first to come to mind. The ever-changing nature of such existence reflects well in this peculiar hue that influences the perceiver's sovereign soul in abundance."
3,"Yellow, the association with that of golden makes it represent value for many. And indeed, such a value conjures envy, greed, and unfounded pride, all from those who possess much to possess not. An abstract object of worship, yet all the same as many other such idols."
4,"Purple, its supposed rareness in the natural world causes many in power and wealth to associate it in themselves. The regality of such a subject is not for debate as much as the prohibition for lower society to even possess or dye it on their possessions."
5,"Green, the central balance of the Chromatism Circular Principle that represents modesty among the extremes. Indeed, such a colour provokes calmness like often encountered in abundance when one glances at the vert nature."
6,"Black, or perhaps the void of colour as some theorised, is the basis of summation for all beings, for the void is beginning in all things. Many also associate it with unknowns and corruption, for only in blackness they can look but know not what they see."
7,"Orange or yellow-red, as often termed, represent an abundance for passion and wealth in correct combinations oftentimes leading to such a phenomenon."
8,"Grey, with its representative silver, symbolises humility in all things in contrast to gold. A wisdom that can only be attained with understanding in life."
