The folder moveset contains action move of each character. It is possible to modify the data already in the file but change of ID of the item can
cause error or incorrect application of the item.

like 0.1) with the header with "modifier" in name then it is most likely that the value represent percentage modifier (e.g., 0.1 is equal to 110% and -0.1 is equal to 90%)
