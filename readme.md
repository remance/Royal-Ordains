# How to run/compile

If you want to download the release version to test the game, go
to [Release](https://github.com/remance/Royal-Ordains/releases) tags and [**
download**](https://github.com/remance/Royal-Ordains/releases/download/0.1/royal-ordains.rar) the zip file. <br>

## Run

To start testing the game run `main.py` via Python interpreter for the source code or `main` file directly for the
release version. <br>

## Compile

To compile the source code into an executable program, recommend using pyinstaller and `main.spec`. <br>

Check the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file for dependency requirements if running with the python source
code.<br>

Also, the game is currently written based on the pygame 2.5.2 module and python 3.11. Using older versions of the two
likely will cause error.



# Game Features

- Play a custom battle against an AI opponent.

- Call in hundreds of ground and air troops to wage a full-blown battle.

- 2 Factions with 50 unique characters and more to come.
